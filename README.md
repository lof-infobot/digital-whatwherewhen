#Digital WhatWhereWhen

##Library Choices
 - [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs) with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)

##About
As of first commit, this project was created with the following Ionic CLI invocation:

`ionic start digital-whatwherewhen tabs --type=react`

The ionic CLI is pretty cool; you should check it out.

##What Next?
- Install redux
- Create initial redux dummy JSON data payload
- Modify tabs to match names of these proposed areas:
  - *The Burn*: A tab for all general burn-related content (art grants, survival guide, etc)
  - *Events*: A browseable/searchable event listing, making the bulk of the digital WWW
  - *Map*: A pinch-zoomable static map showing locations of theme camps and portos
