title-block,The Petite Perseverance Advisory (PPA),The Petite Perseverance Advisory is your Survival Guide cheat sheet.  We made sure to keep all the gems that help you enjoy Lakes of Fire while suriving successfully.
real-talk,Real Talk,"Lakes of Fire’s site, Lucky Lake Campground, is privately owned and operated by our friends an trusted partners.  Please comply with any reasonable request that law enforcement, your organizers, your hosts, or their employees make of you.  Failure to do so is grounds for removal from Lakes of Fire, and that’s way less of a good time."
banned,Banned in the LoF,"Fireworks, Chinese lanterns, weapons, drones, illegal substances, handheld lasers, glitter and trampolines are not allowed.  If you brought any of these items, please return them to your vehicle and leave them there.  There are darn good reasons each of these items are listed, thanks.a"
nexus,Nexus,"The large tent, near the greeters is The Nexus, our Center Camp!  Stop by all day for fun and interactive activities.  There are volunteers to help answer any questions you may have, from getting directions to finding a volunteer shift or two."
at-the-burn,At the Burn...,"- Bags of ice and bundles of firewood are available for sale, cash only, at the trailer across from the Nexus in the Center Camp area.
- Potable water is available from a number of locations.
- Remember that while some places are quieter than others, the only place at Lucky Lake that will be reliably quiet are the Chill and Quiet Zones in the Back 40 neighborhood.  In the Chill Zone, there is no amplified sound from midnight to 9 AM.  In the Quiet Zone there is no amplified sound, period!
- There are no lifeguards; swim at your own risk.
- Porta-Potties are set up around the lake.  Only the 3 Ps are allowed in Porta-Potties: Pee, Poop, and Paper.  No wet wipes, tampons, plastic, or any other objects.  “Please do not poop in the forest or lake.” - Skennedy
- Respect the art and artists at Lakes of Fire by only modifying artwork with the permission of the artist.  If you see someone vandalizing artwork, ask them to stop or inform a Ranger if necessary.
- Please be cautious about leaving valuable possessions unattended, in your tent, or visible in your car.  While theft is rare, sadly, it does happen."
consent,Consent,"Radical self expression can take many forms - what’s important to recognize is that none of that is an invitation to invade someone else’s personal space or make physical advances.

Nudity, skimpy clothing, or even raunchy behavior is not an invitation for any form of intimate physical contact.  The only invitation is a clearly spoken invitation.  Bottom line?  Just be cool by respecting other people’s bodies and personal space."
photography,Photography,"Lakes of Fire is a private event and we expect participants to approach photography respectfully.  Ask first.  If you can identify anyone in the picture, you should have asked for their consent first."
volunteering,Volunteering,"Lakes of Fire is an entirely volunteer-run event.  We are always looking for enthusiastic burners that want to help out.  If you’re looking to volunteer, come visit the Nexus at Center Camp.  We’re always looking for more hands!"
camping,Camping,"- Please be responsible about your tent stakes and rope to prevent injuries.  Illuminating guide wires and ground stakes are highly recommended.
- All structures, including tie-downs, must be inside the campsite markers and not obstructing or obscuring pathways.
- All generators must have a sound baffle."
vehicle-camping,Vehicle Camping,Car camping is permissible only if you have a medical condition and an approved LMNOP Vehicle Permit from DPW/Parking.  Violators will be towed at their expense.  RVs must park in either open camping or in a theme camp.  There are no electric hook-ups available for RVs in open camping.
campfires,Campfires,"A limited number of campfire rings have been placed by DPW.  Campfire rings and burn barrels may not be installed or moved without approval from DPW (Department of Public Works).

If your site needs a fire ring or you wish to use a burn barrel, contact DPW by visiting their camp or stopping a DPW vehicle.

**Keyhole Theme Camps**: Fire rings or fire on the ground is NOT allowed, but elevated burn barrels are allowed. FAST requests that all fire, other than cooking stoves, be placed on the road/path side of your camp.

We request, as always, that any open fire (flame effect or burn barrel) have a fire extinguisher in close proximity to the fire in case of an emergency. But please, not right next to the fire.

NO fire is allowed in open camping except for small propane cook stoves.

All structures must be at least 12 feet away from any fire rings and burn barrels, and burn barrels must be raised on concrete blocks.

Only burn materials that are non-toxic and burnable (your plastic, cigarette filters, and cans are NOT safe to burn).

Campfires and burn barrels must either be actively attended or completely out (cold to the touch) when unattended.

You must clean out your campfire ring (ash, wood, and all) before leaving.  Unburned firewood may be stacked neatly next to fire ring."
lnt,Leave No Trace,"Leave No Trace means that we must leave the site in better condition than we found it.  Each participant must remove all items they brought with them - including their trash - when they leave the site.

We also ask that each participant helps by picking up any litter / Matter Out Of Place (MOOP) that they encounter.  Smokers, bring a portable ash tray.

Please respect the greater community by not dumping your trash at the nearest rest stop.  There will be a trash collection station at the end of Gate Road during Exodus.  You may pay $5/bag to dump moop before leaving the property (no furniture).  The proceeds, less the dumpster fee, will be donated to the local Fire Department.  Please don’t forget to drop off your returnables at Recycle Camp!"
health,Health and Safety,"Our proud volunteers in yellow are our Emergency Services Department. All of our Medical Team volunteers are trained and certified Healthcare providers, many with EMS and ER experience. They’re on hand to triage and treat most any medical problems or injuries or assist with wayward fires or participants.

Intoxicants and water don’t mix.  Alcohol makes it far likelier that you will drown if you enter the water.  Always take a friend and don’t swim alone.

Mental Health volunteers will be available as needed. A Sanctuary will be provided for those who need a quiet, calm space where you can speak to someone or take a breather.

The ESD Tent will be clearly marked on the Lakes of Fire map. Seek help at ESD directly, or we can come to you. Please ask an on-duty ESD volunteer or Ranger if you need medical or mental health assistance.

If you have a pre-existing medical condition that you feel may become a problem during the event, please make a campmate aware of it and inform the ESD Medical Team. If you have any questions, feel free to approach any on-duty ESD volunteer."
emergencies,Emergencies Involving 911,"ESD volunteers are also your portal to off-site medical care locations. While you have the right to contact 911 directly, please try and route the request through a Ranger or an ESD Team volunteer so that we can remain “in the loop” and facilitate. In the event, you need to be evacuated to a hospital or wish to travel to one yourself, contact ESD Medical. We will provide information or assistance to get you to the local hospital or Urgent Care Center."
rangers,Rangers: Here to Help,"Lakes of Fire Rangers are first and foremost citizens of Lakes of Fire. They help to preserve the safety, welfare, and quality of experience of our community while supporting participants. They are burners and participants just like you – they are not “law enforcement.” You can spot LoF Rangers by their all-khaki outfits with the Ranger logo and their Ranger hat!

Pairs of Rangers can be found circulating the event 24/7, helping out as needed. They carry radios to access additional resources such as Emergency Services (Fire & Medical) and are trained to mediate disputes.

Rangers do prefer that you practice radical self-reliance first, and ask for help second – but participants are encouraged to ask for assistance when they need it."
parenting,Parenting at Lakes,"Little burners under 18 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, both at entry, and at all times during the event.

You are responsible for the welfare of minors in your care. It’s your responsibility to determine how much of it your li’l burners are exposed to.

Failing to adequately supervise minors in your care is your fastest ticket out of Lakes of Fire, as you will be immediately ejected without exception or recourse.

Let your kids know in advance about the kind of things that they will or might see and hear. Nudity, iconoclastic art, sexuality, rude language, cultural commentary, and weird behavior are all a part of any Burn. Talk to them about common-sense safety – advise them to be cautious about getting too close to aggressive art, destructive robots, moving vehicles, and playing in ash heaps or burn scars.

Babies cannot consent to the bangin’ tunes at a sound camp – you may want to consider earplugs or noise blocking earmuffs."
fire-safety,Fire Performance Safety,"Fire is a spectacular part of our event when done safely and in a controlled manner. The Fire Art Safety Team (F.A.S.T.) requires that you contact us first regarding fire spinning performances, fire sculptures, flame effects and open fires.

All physical fire art requires prior pre-event signup. All fire art requires inspection on-site, which may require a phone interview to discuss your art and safety plan. F.A.S.T. members don’t bite – they limit risk and prevent friends from getting hurt.

A fire safety training is hosted every year onsite. This training is geared towards fire performers (spinners and breathers), but all are welcome. There are typically two trainings, one on Friday and one on Saturday. Please check the WhatWhereWhen for the locations and times. If you plan on participating in the Fire Conclave performance preceding the Burn (which you should!) you must attend an LoF specific fire safety training."
exodus,Exodus Sunday,"All participants except for select volunteers must be off the property by 3:00 P.M.

Please make sure to Leave No Trace of your campsite and try to pick up anything you may find along the way.
