summary,Sound at Lakes of Fire,"Amplified sound is an integral part of Lakes of Fire.  Artistic expression through the medium of sound is highly encouraged and appreciated by the Lakes of Fire community and organization, provided it does not threaten the event as a whole.  Unfortunately, the cumulative and far-reaching effects of sound can potentially endanger Lakes of Fire’s continued presence at any particular location.

All participants bringing amplified sound are required to sign a Sound Agreement and display a Sound Permit prominently by their sound source.

The Sound Team will be monitoring and working with sound camps throughout the event.  Infractions will be marked and logged for future use."

strike-policy,Three Strikes Enforcement Procedure,"**STRIKE ONE**: A friendly chat to make sure that you know where your levels should be, as well as a reminder of the sound policy and how it will be enforced.  Please respect the limits that are put in place to protect the community and the event.

**STRIKE TWO**: A stern warning, we know you are well aware of the policy, as well as where your levels should be and how to keep them there.  You deliberately violated it putting the event and community at risk.  Please for everyone’s sake, do not let it happen again.

**STRIKE THREE**: Regardless of intention, you and your sound system are a problem.  The Rangers and Board will be informed that your system is to be powered off for the remainder of the night.  Additionally, since you have proven to be incapable of self-managing your volume, subsequent Turn-Down Times will be Turn Off Times for your camp/mutant vehicle/project.  You have lost late night sound privileges for Lakes of Fire.  Shame on you!  Boo."
